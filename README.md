# BukuKita

A book sharing app where you can freely rent out your books and have yourself a personal rentable library or even rent other peopleâ€™s personal libraries, all from the comfort of your phone. BukuKita is meant to connect willing book owners with potential renters who want to read a specific book, but are unable to buy it themselves. Also BukuKita helps YOU actually have people read the books that you just let rot in your room! Rent your books today!
